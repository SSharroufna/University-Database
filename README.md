## Introduction
The objective of this project is to write an application that reads a list of University courses from a data file and then inserts them into two separate hash tables.
The first hash table will use the Open Addressing collision resolution scheme and the second hash table will use the Chaining collision resolution scheme.
- Users should be able to search the hash tables for a specific course number or display all of the courses. 
- The application should maintain a list of courses taught by each professor by using a binary search tree data structure.
- Users should be able to search for a professor and view all of the courses taught by the Professor.
